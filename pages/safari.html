        <h2>Safari</h2>
        <h3>Masai Village</h3>
        <p>
          One of the highlights of my experience in Kenya was visiting the local Maasai community.
          Its culture is so interesting and open. I had the opportunity to interact with the native people and hear
          their remarkable stories. It was a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity that opened my eyes up to another world.
        </P>

        <h3>Safari</h3>
        <p>
          With stunning landscapes and captivating wildlife, there are only a handful of experiences that are on par
          with an African safari.
        </p>

        <h2>How a typical day might unfold...</h3>
        <h3>Early morning</h4>
        <p>
          An early start means an equally early wake-up call. Tea and biscuits are served at about 6am and at sunrise you head off on your early-morning game-drive.
          This is generally the best time to spot the wildlife, as the temperature is cool and the animals are still very active,
          including the big cats, which will be returning from a night of hunting.
        </p>

        <h3>Late morning</h4>
        <p>
          After a few hours, you will either return to your camp/lodge for a hearty breakfast,
          or have a bush breakfast out on the plains and then return just before the heat of the day.
        </p>

        <h3>Lunch and afternoon</h4>
        <p>
          You usually have lunch in the camp/lodge and spend the main part of the day either relaxing or using the amenities,
          such as an outdoor pool. You might have something to eat and drink at around 3pm before heading out for another game-drive.
        </p>

        <h3>Evening</h4>
        <p>
          As with early morning, the evening game drive is often the best time to see the wildlife.
          The predatory animals begin to stir from their heat-of-the-day slumber, and similarly, their prey become ever more active and alert as darkness falls.
          Vehicles usually return just before dark in time for a shower, pre-dinner drinks and then dinner. The evenings are often rounded off with
          a few drinks around the campfire, warming toes and swapping safari stories.
        </p>

        <h3>Night</h4>
        <p>
          Sometimes, you will have the opportunity to go on a game-drive at night. Vehicles are equipped with powerful spotlights,
          as well as expert trackers who will generally spot any wildlife well before you will. This is often the best time to spot the elusive leopard,
          which more-often-than-not will be high up in a tree. A game-drive at night gives you a completely different perspective of the bush and is an unforgettable experience.
